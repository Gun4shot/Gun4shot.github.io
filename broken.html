Tittle was suggested by the main character of this story.
<br>
<br>
<b>Based on true incidents.</b>
<br>
<br>
On a Saturday afternoon, avi a 15 year old teenage boy was scrolling through his phone like any other teenagers these days. Ofcourse he was bored of this, after countless hours of scrolling through his phone a message popped up.
<br>
<br>
Avi was startled from the ring of the new message. It was from his close friend, prabesh. Out of curiosity he opened the message and it said,"Oeee, avi", "Tell" avi replied. Prabesh then told him," There is this new girl living in rent just below me, I just got her fb id, do you wanna talk to her?" By talk, Prabesh meant impress her and eventually make her your gf. Avi wasn't interested in such sorts of delusions and thought prabesh was just lying to him. So Avi straight up rejected him. 
<br>
<br>
But our story takes a turn here, Avi's life gets changed when he goes to school tye next day. Upon arriving on school the day, Avi meets Prabesh. Prabesh upon seeing Avi immediately pulled him towards the class and wishpered,"You remember the girl I told you yesterday? She goes to the same school as us and she's in the next class, you wanna meet her?" At first Avi wasn't interested in the girl but Prabesh was forcing Avi so bad that he eventually agreed with meeting the girl.
<br>
<br>
That was the decision that left his heart broken, a broken hero was born due to this decision. But now something different happens.
<br>
<br>
Prashesh and Avi both went towards the class of the girl. Prabesh called the girl outside. And she agreed, she came out of her class and saw avi. She felt a new feeling that she had never felt before. Her world had a new shine to it. Her heart was beating rapidly, her face was red, she was feeling warm from inside . A new sensation, what it was she wondered. 
<br>
<br>
She felt anxious meeting Avi for the first time and couldn't speak a word. She felt like it was just her and avi alone together. She stared right at avi but she couldn't say anything. Ofcourse the cause of all this was avi, she was charmed by him. A tall, handsome man calling for a girl just outside her class, who wouldn't feel flustered ?
<br>
<br>
Avi slowly glanced towards the girl, avi was not nervous as he wasn't so much interested in the girl. In a casual way, avi asked for the girls name. The girl was nervous just to tell her name. In a soft and innocent voice the girl replied "Je...Jenny", " Ohh my, what a cute name.." avi mumbled. 
<br>
<br>
Jenny hearing this almost fainted there. Her heart was about to explode. He ears were red as beetroot, she couldn't Mutter a single word from her mouth. As she was enjoying the grace of avi, the school bell rang and both of them as well as Prabesh went to their classes. Inside the class Prabesh asked Avi how jenny was? Avi replied" idk, she was alright I guess" although avi still had no feeling for her yet, jenny sure had developed a lot of feeling for avi. It was love at first sight for jenny. 
<br>
<br>
After returning home from school, avi checked his phone and there was a new notification from fb, there was a new friend request, avi checked it out and no surprise it was form jenny. Avi accepted the friend request and immediately a new message popped up it was from jenny. 
<br>
<br>
Avi was quite surprised from how fast she was. They went on chatting for quite a bit after that. They both had a wonderful time chatting about their day and various topics together. Jenny was having the time of her life. Here avi was starting to develop an interest on her. Without knowing they had been chatting for 3 hours already without an end. It was dark outside. But there was a bright light inside Jenny's heart.
<br>
<br>
The two of them chatted like this everyday and slowly but surely they got close to each other. But one day this all changed surely and a new chapter for the, began.....
<br>
<br>
<b>P.S :</b><i> As I don't know the real life events in detail, I have very little knowledge about what really happened and the main character refuses to tell me all the things in detail. So, I couldn't write this story in much more details. I am leaving most parts upon my imagination but the main story line remains real and authentic. Thank you.</i>

<br>
Chapter 1 End.

  <h2>Chapter 2, The picture</h2>
      <hr style="border: 3px dashed #EDE;" />
      <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
It was like an everyday evening for avi. The cold wind of monsoon breezing through the windows of his house. He sitting on his bed scrolling on his phone.... but this night, it was a bit different, this was the night when his heart fell....it was a dark night when he got this feeling, it was this night that started it all. 
<br>
<br>
Avi and jenny were chatting like usual, they were playing a game of truth and dare, avi chooses truth and he is asked by Jennie what's his type? Avi kind of getting a hint, answers " Idk...Someone like you I guess" Reading this Jennie blushes. Avi that night felt a different vibe from what he felt other time, he was in a new mood, in a cheerful mood, in a mood he was never before, he was in a mood of love. 
<br>
<br>
Jennie chooses dare next, and avi dared her to send a photo of herself. Avi himself didn't know why he dare her something so bizzare like this? But at that time he was in control of his heart, the heart which loved someone. Reading this message jennie got shocked for a while but eventually even she agreed to it. She was quite shy to send avi her photo but she took up the courage and opened the camera. She turned the camera to herself. With a Teddy bear in her left hand and the phone on her right hand, she clicked on the photo button, the timer started....3....2 ...1.... jenny made a cute and innocent face and the photo clicked, jenny was quite unsure if she should send this photo or not. But without overthinking further, she just clicked on the send button. 
<br>
<br>
A message popped on avi's screen, "downloading photo" seeing this avi couldn't hold himself back,Â  he got very eager to see the photo. The photo loaded slowly and when avi saw the photo, he dropped the phone from his hand, that was the photo that let the bird free, the bird of love was set free from within Avi's heart. He picked up his phone and saved the image immediately. Avi had no reply for the pic, he simply said good night turned off his WiFi and went to sleep, but how could he sleep when he just saw such a heavenly thing. Avi's heart was beating very loudly, there was pin drop silence in the room, the beating of his heart could be heard out loud. Avi couldn't even try to sleep whenever he closed his eyes, the same image popped up. 
<br>
<br>
Avi couldn't get a single wink of sleep that night. The day when he went to school he had dark circles under his eyes, seeing this Prabesh commented, " Hey, Avi didn't you sleep last night or did you spend you whole night talking with jenny?" To this avi replied," kind of" prabesh meant that as a joke but Avi's reply left him shocked. 
<br>
<br>
The day went on and avi couldn't pay attention in any of his class, all he was thinking was the heavenly picture which he had seen yesterday, "how could she be so cute he thought." At lunch break just as avi stepped outside his class room he saw jenny, at first glance both of them stared at each other, they didn't speak a single word but their eyes spoke a lot, they were in love with each other or that was what Avi thought. Avi slowly approached jenny and told her, "The photo yesterday...... well it was cute." Saying this avi left to get lunch." Jenny was speechless after hearing this, she felt kind of happy and more attracted towards avi. 
<br>
<br>
Avi knew jenny also shared some feelings towards avi, now it was just a matter of who proposed first. Avi wanted to hold the confession till class 10 but he realized that the golden opportunity which he has currently may be lost of he waited too long. 
<br>
<br>
Opportunities don't come often, when they come don't miss them, although it might be hard you will surely get a reward. If you miss a opportunity don't cloud your eyes with tears so that you won't miss the next one. Those who never miss an opportunity are those who always succeed in life. 
<br>
<br>
Knowing it was a golden time avi made up the mind to propose to jenny....

  <h2>Chapter 3, The proposal ?</h2>
      <hr style="border: 3px dashed #EDE;" />
      
<p>
<br>
<br>
"What is love ? Why is this feeling or what is this feeling? how strange is it...." Avi was wondering sitting at the corner of his bench, it was maths period, boring as usual, sun sparkling through the window of the classroom, the twilight falling on avi's desk, it was warm just like this strange feeling inside Avi's heart. He was in a deep thought, a thought about someone, a thought about Jenny. At this point the feelings inside Avis heart built up a lot, he just couldn't hold it in, it was like his heart was about to burst. 
<br>
<br>
"AVI", maths teacher shouted. Avi got startled from this. "Pay attention ", the maths teacher further added. The class was filled with jiggles of students. Avi didn't care about that a single bit, all he cared was how he would now propose to jenny. After maths period Avi consulted Prabesh. Prabesh was sitting just in the bench infront of him. Avi called on Prabesh and said, "Hey, I wanted to tell you something." "What", Prabesh questioned. "I like someone...." Hearing this Prabesh got very exicted, and he immediately asked who it was. Avi in a lower voice murmured," its....j....j..jenny." Prabesh looked at Avi's face with a sense of surprise, he was quite shocked by it, but it felt like he knew from before it was coming. Prabesh further told Avi," I knew it, you would like her, but I didn't know it would be so soon." Avi was quite embarrassed but they soon started to talk more openly about it and started to make a plan about the proposal.
<br>
<br>
----The proposal----
<br>
<br>
What is love? The feeling of attraction towards another person physically or mentally. This can be one of the it's definition but ofcourse there are countless definitions of love out there but the true meaning of love can never be put into words. Love is something you can't force upon some one, it just finds its own way, just like a river, finding its own way towards the sea. The water in the river must come from somewhere, it comes from the snow capped mountains in the himalayas, or the glaciers of the himalayas, which is melted by the sun into the river. For the river to flow the sun must melt the ice into water. Here, for Avi's love to reach Jenny's, he must let the river of his love flow. 
<br>
<br>
Avi's class was at the top floor of the school or the fifth floor, lucky for Avi, Jenny's class was also at the same floor. It was Nepali period, sir was teaching as usual, but avi wasn't even paying attention, the repetition of the same school hours, the same poems from the same teacher, hearing it multiple times, Avi was simply burned out, he wanted a break from all this, he wanted something that will bring a new energy to his life, he needed someone who could return Avi's feelings and that was Jenny. Avi stared into the green hills, the hills filled with evergreen trees. Staring into the beauty of the forest, he could see Jenny in the sky, it was just his imagination but it peaked too far, he could hear the chirping of the birds, the loud noises of children from other classes, the teacher trying to control the children, the back benchers pulling of another prank with the teacher. Suddenly the bell stared to ring. Everyone started to make noise and pack up there bags whereas Avi was already packed up from the beginning. The students shouted and rushed towards the door, in a hurry to g to their houses, probably to look at their phones, or some might even be hungry. Avi's intention was different then of others, he was in a hurry so that he could meet jenny. Avi made up his mind to ask jenny out while they were going home. 
<br>
<br>
Avi rushed downstairs, he was looking all around for jenny, here and there... but finally he found her. She was just about to leave with her friends. Without any hesitation he said " Jenny lets go home together" he was still huffing and puffing due to shortage of breathe, avi was staring right at jenny's eyes and jenny was staring right back him. After seeing those bright eyes of Avi, she said " yeah, sure."
<br>
<br>
It was the same street, the same way home, when avi and jenny walked countless times, but it didn't feel the same way that day, it all felt different to both them. It was the same bumps in the road, but it felt different to them, it was the same temple they always saw but it was different that day, it was the same transport facility but it was different that day, it was the same sky but different that day,it was the same street light but different that day. Even though it was the old surrounding, both of them felt it very new. As a new start of their chapter was prevailing.
<br>
<br>
Both of them walked side by side to each other, making almost no conversations, there was this silence between them but it seemed both of the, enjoyed it. While walking down the same old street, a dog came by and sniffed jenny. Jenny got frightened seeing the dog coming so close to her, out if natural instincts, she squiked and clinged on to avi,the dog ofcourse went its own way but here the situation was burning up, jenny was wrapped around Avi's arm, he could feel Jenny's heart pounding and Jenny could feel Avi's. The warmth from Jenny make Avi even more nervous. Jenny had her face red like a tomato," I am sorry, it was my instincts" Jenny said, Avi said that it was not a problem. Just as jenny was starting to walk ahead, Avi held Jenny's hand, he held it firmly. Jenny was startled by this, she quickly turned around and stared right a Avi, here Avi was making quite a embarrassed face, he was lurking his eyes around, his face was super red, he couldn't even make eye contact with Jenny. He now tightly held onto Jennys arm, made proper eye contact with her and described the feelings of his heart as,
<br>
"Jenny, I have had to tell you something forÂ  a while now. I think you probably know it but I still want to say it in a proper way. It's the reason why I asked you to walk home with me.
(Taking a deep breath) I wanted to tell you that, when I talked with you for the first time, I didn't understand you at all, I didn't even remember your name for the first time, but as you talked with me further I was quite invested into you, my attention for you got so far that I lot the count if time when I talked with you, i could talk with you for hours, whenever I talk with you, whenever I am with you I feel at a sense of ease that I fell around nobody else, you are the one that makes my heart pound, I guess it was meant to beat for you, when I look in you eyes, I get engrossed in them, I get lost within them, when you were in my arms, my heart stared to beat like crazy, I can't st thinking thinking about you, I always wonder wonder you are doing, I feel jealous when you are too close to other men, I feel like wanting to keep you all by myself. I know it's a bit selfish but I want to ask, Will you be mine?"
<br>
<br>
Jenny had no word for this proposal, she had tears in her eyes, with a wobbly voice she replied,"Yes, I love you and I loved you from the beginning" Hearing those words Avi jumped for his excitement both of them threw themselves at the arms of each other and embraced each other for a long time. They didn't want this delightful moment to end. Under the rising sunset the new couple hugged each other with no intention of letting go. This was the happily ever after for Avi san or was it?
<br>
<br>
The end ?
<br>
The answer is no. The story is just beginning, a love without any obstacles? The main story begins now, the plot begins now.....
