   <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
   <p>
<br>
<br>
Tittle was suggested by the main character of this story.
<br>
<br>
<b>Based on true incidents.</b>
<br>
<br>
On a Saturday afternoon, avi a 15 year old teenage boy was scrolling through his phone like any other teenagers these days. Ofcourse he was bored of this, after countless hours of scrolling through his phone a message popped up.
<br>
<br>
Avi was startled from the ring of the new message. It was from his close friend, prabesh. Out of curiosity he opened the message and it said,"Oeee, avi", "Tell" avi replied. Prabesh then told him," There is this new girl living in rent just below me, I just got her fb id, do you wanna talk to her?" By talk, Prabesh meant impress her and eventually make her your gf. Avi wasn't interested in such sorts of delusions and thought prabesh was just lying to him. So Avi straight up rejected him. 
<br>
<br>
But our story takes a turn here, Avi's life gets changed when he goes to school tye next day. Upon arriving on school the day, Avi meets Prabesh. Prabesh upon seeing Avi immediately pulled him towards the class and wishpered,"You remember the girl I told you yesterday? She goes to the same school as us and she's in the next class, you wanna meet her?" At first Avi wasn't interested in the girl but Prabesh was forcing Avi so bad that he eventually agreed with meeting the girl.
<br>
<br>
That was the decision that left his heart broken, a broken hero was born due to this decision. But now something different happens.
<br>
<br>
Prashesh and Avi both went towards the class of the girl. Prabesh called the girl outside. And she agreed, she came out of her class and saw avi. She felt a new feeling that she had never felt before. Her world had a new shine to it. Her heart was beating rapidly, her face was red, she was feeling warm from inside . A new sensation, what it was she wondered. 
<br>
<br>
She felt anxious meeting Avi for the first time and couldn't speak a word. She felt like it was just her and avi alone together. She stared right at avi but she couldn't say anything. Ofcourse the cause of all this was avi, she was charmed by him. A tall, handsome man calling for a girl just outside her class, who wouldn't feel flustered ?
<br>
<br>
Avi slowly glanced towards the girl, avi was not nervous as he wasn't so much interested in the girl. In a casual way, avi asked for the girls name. The girl was nervous just to tell her name. In a soft and innocent voice the girl replied "Je...Jenny", " Ohh my, what a cute name.." avi mumbled. 
<br>
<br>
Jenny hearing this almost fainted there. Her heart was about to explode. He ears were red as beetroot, she couldn't Mutter a single word from her mouth. As she was enjoying the grace of avi, the school bell rang and both of them as well as Prabesh went to their classes. Inside the class Prabesh asked Avi how jenny was? Avi replied" idk, she was alright I guess" although avi still had no feeling for her yet, jenny sure had developed a lot of feeling for avi. It was love at first sight for jenny. 
<br>
<br>
After returning home from school, avi checked his phone and there was a new notification from fb, there was a new friend request, avi checked it out and no surprise it was form jenny. Avi accepted the friend request and immediately a new message popped up it was from jenny. 
<br>
<br>
Avi was quite surprised from how fast she was. They went on chatting for quite a bit after that. They both had a wonderful time chatting about their day and various topics together. Jenny was having the time of her life. Here avi was starting to develop an interest on her. Without knowing they had been chatting for 3 hours already without an end. It was dark outside. But there was a bright light inside Jenny's heart.
<br>
<br>
The two of them chatted like this everyday and slowly but surely they got close to each other. But one day this all changed surely and a new chapter for the, began.....
<br>
<br>
<b>P.S :</b><i> As I don't know the real life events in detail, I have very little knowledge about what really happened and the main character refuses to tell me all the things in detail. So, I couldn't write this story in much more details. I am leaving most parts upon my imagination but the main story line remains real and authentic. Thank you.</i>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 1 End.
