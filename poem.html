 <p>Time really flies by....<br>
I still remember, when my mind held no stress,<br>
But now they threw me in this inevitable race.<br>
I was innocent not very wise<br>
The cruel reality of this world I never went on to realize <br>
<br>
<br>
I still remember <br>
From a young age I was told, I was above the average<br>
In reality I was just lost in a huge maize.<br>
Never knew what path to take next<br>
Took the words of others thinking it was the best<br>
But that was a blunder made in haste <br>
<br>
<br>
I still remember, when I was scared of the dark,<br>
now the eyes of people around me, they lurk<br>
They thought of me as some kind of genius <br>
But never got to know the dark side of me which was heinous <br>
<br>
<br>
I still remember,together with you the fun times I had<br>
Now it's so silent and calm, it's just too sad<br>
I wish I could live all those moments just once more<br>
But Time never comes back, that's the sad lore <br>
<br>
<br>
Spent years of my life never understanding this society <br>
I am at the turning point now where I have constant anxiety <br>
I have no clue on what path I should take <br>
I wish life was as easy as cake<br>
<br>
<br>
Even the blaze of the moon will someday come to an end<br>
Till that time I don't want my life to desend <br>
I am not scared of death <br>
But I am scared if I die with any regret<br>
<br>
<br>
I still remember, at every small thing I used to cry<br>
The fact I was immature, I used to deny<br>
Looking at the birds I wanted to fly<br>
I couldn't speak to anyone, I was so shy<br>
All the times I used to lie<br>
Used to think myself as someone high<br>
But now I am here, truly, time really files by..... </p>
