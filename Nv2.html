   <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
    <p>    In the middle of the pandemic, when everyone was locked in their house, I was also locked but i had some connections with the outside world thanks to online classes.
    <br>
     I had no interest in studies but there was a specific someone who made me join the online classes. What I thought would be boring turned into a roller coaster of emotions.
     <br> 
      Spring has bloomed in my life. I had hit puberty and like any other person my heart had experienced something called "LOVE."</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Chapter-2
     It was a normal boring day in my online class but who knew this boring day would turn into the most cheerful day of my life. As I was scrolling through the pages of my zoom class, my eyes stumbled upon pra... pra... prakash-san.
     <br> I knew him since class 3 and knew how kind he was, i liked him from way before but not romanticly. As his beautiful eyes looked at me me through the zoom screen my heart skipped a beat. As my eyes and his eyes met together, I felt discomfort in my heart but it didn't pain but instead it felt good. I was pretty sure that he wasn't looking at me but my heart denied that fact. It felt like he and i were the only 2 humans in this earth.As i saw him smiling through my mobile's screen my heart also smiled, my heart skipped a bit and beat rapidly . I thought something was wrong with me but it wasn't anything wrong.... it was "LOVE."</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <hr>
    <h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>
     <p> People say love is the best feeling in the world and during that time I felt it true. The rapid beating of my heart and loosing of my consciousness, it all happened to me. I was always thinking about prakash-san and imagined weird scenarios with him.
     <br>
     I was head over heels for him, I always looked at him during the online classes. I didn't pay attention to the teacher. It was like I just joined online classes to watch him only. As time passed by I contacted him through messanger. At first I would only ask notes and homeworks. I never got the courage to ask him about any other thing. Things continued in this slow pace and we didn't make much progress. 
     <br>
     As the pandemic dropped down, the schools started reopening. I was obviously very exicted about it and was eagerly waiting to see prakash-san. I was probably the most excited person to go to school. I waited days and nights for the school days just to see one person. I thought what that one person did to me and how much I changed. I used to hate school and now I cant wait to go to school. Even my parents were amazed to see me this energetic. Days passes and came the day before school. I was a bit nervous and made all the preparations. I gave it my all so that I could look perfect and attractive in school. Ofcourse I just wanted Prakash-san to notice me. I went to slerp that day but due to nervousness and excitement I couldn't sleep till 1 pm.
     <br>
     Then arrived the day that I had been waiting months for. I could finally see prakash-san. I thought I would get Prakash-san's attention and get a bit closer to him, but fate didn't support me. It was like I was destined to loose. The plans which I thought in my head didn't go accordingly......

    <h3>CHAPTER 4</h3>
    <p>I had thought of a plan to sit closeby him, but to my surprise that went horribly wrong. When I entered the class most of the seats were taken, I thought I had arrived early but everyone else was faster then me, the seat across Prakash-san was already taken, it was taken by another girl named, Asmita. I was envious of her. Asmita was closer to Prakash-San then I was, they lived in the same neighbourhood so they often went home together. With my broken heart and desperate mind I took the second last seat of my class. I watched upon Prakash-san from across the classroom with my ears yearning to hear Prakash-san's voice. I gave up all my hope and went on with my day. 
    <br>
Recess arrived and I was looking at my lunch my mother packed for me with no intention of eating it. I glanced over at Prakash-san and he was there enjoying his lunch with his friends and Asmita-san, I got really jealous of her. I didn't have any close friends. I would talk to some but we weren't really close so there wasn't anyone with whom I could share my problems. I thought to myself " how nice would it be if I could talk to Prakash-san, be close with him, laugh with him, help him.....". As I was going through all these thoughts in my mind, someone fell on me. ( not literally but like someone pushed someone onto me) I was caught with surprise, as I was about to burst out in anger, I saw the person who fell on me was......</p> 
    <br>

    <br>
    <h3>CHAPTER 5</h3>
    <p>The candle which once shined upon my heart was blown away and I lived in complete darkness... today was the day when light fell into my dark world, the candle which once was blown relighted...
    <br>
The person who fell onto me was Prakash-san, his friends pushed him onto me as a joke probably by mistake, my heart started to pound very hard. Prakash-san immediately got up and said, " I am so sorry, are you hurt anywhere?" With these words my heart was beating faster then ever, it felt like my body would explode. I was so nervous I couldn't say a word. With all the courage I said YE...S, my voice cracked, I felt so embarrassed that my face was as red a tomato, he slowly simmered and backed away, he told me to take care and went back to his friends. My mind was in confusion from what had just happened. I had forgotten all my anxiety from the morning and was energetic then ever before. 
The bell rang and everyone got into the class. The next period, was of science which was taught by Danish Sir, he asked a chemical reaction as, 
<br>
    Cu+H2So4=..........
<br>
And asked any of us to solve it, everyone looked confused but from the third bench someone raised a hand, it was Prakash-san, he went to the white board and solve the reaction, everyone clapped for him and I was amazed by how easily he solved the problem, while he was returning to his seat, Ashmita said," Wow! Prakash-san, you are so good at science, can u teach me sometime?" With a bright smile on the face Prakash-san said" hahah sure" I was grudging on the fact that how smooth Asmita was with Prakash-san. I somehow put my mind at ease from that incident. Slowly but surely school ended and I was on the schools gate on my way home, then a mysterious hand suddenly landed on my solder, when I turned back I was amazed to see it was......</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>CHAPTER 6 </h3>
<p> As I turned my head behind I saw that the mysterious person was bokago-san, one of Prakash-san's friend. With a gentle smile on his face he said to me,"I am so sorry, I actually pushed Prakash-san onto you. But believe me it was an accident, please forgive me." I wanted to thank him for pushing Prakash-san but it was a wrong thing to do so i just said it's alright. As I was leaving Bokago-san calls out to me and says," Umm.....if you are free would you like to join us? We are just hanging out in a new cafe that just opened up..." I wasn't interested at first but when Bokago-san said, "Even Prakash-san is there...." I made up my mind, I didn't hear what Bokago-San said past that, I was just exhilarated by the fact that I was going to hang out with Prakash-san. I immediately said," SURE I WOULD LOVE TO GO !" I showed an elevation that I never showed before. Even Bokago-san was a bit bewildered by my thrillness. We walked along the road to the cafe, Bokago-san was making some small talks but, all on my mind was Prakash-san.
<br>
"A frog at the bottom of the well doesn't know about the outside world, it only knows about the water of the well. " At that time I was the frog who knew nothing except Prakash-san.
<br>
As we arrived at the cafe my heart was throbbing like crazy. As I opened the door, my eyes immediately went towards Prakash-san. There he was sitting with a smile and a charming and appealing aura. As we walked towards Prakash-san, I felt a warm sensation in my heart, the aura radiated from Prakash-san kun was so warm,delightful and lovely that it was melting my heart. When we arrived before Prakash-san and others, Bokago-san introduced me to all of them. Everyone seemed happy for me to join them. Prakash-san stood up and bowed down to me apologising for the incident that happened before. I replied,"No problem, I don't mind that at all." As a profound and wholehearted gentleman Prakash-san was, he offered me a seat right next to him. I was over thrilled,  I couldn't believe that my fate was good enough to let me sit right next to me. I took the seat blissfully,just why wouldn't I take the seat? I sat down and the waiter came around asking what we would take? I couldn't make my mind as my mind was all invested in Prakash-san like a moth attracted towards a light. I unknowingly kept staring at Prakash-san and completely ignored the waiter. Prakash-san gently rolled up his eyes partially towards me and with a gentle smile on his face he said to me," Why you look at me like that?" 
<br>
   My face was like a tomato freshly ripe. I was so embarrassed that I almost passed out. "Pfffftt...." Prakash-san laughed. I got so embarrassed I got up and ran towards the restroom. And there I was in an awkward situation randomly running from my table without saying a word....</p>
   <p class=pro>   "Love is like the weather,  sometimes its bright, sometimes it's cloudy, sometimes it is windy and sometimes it even rains, creating a flood and causing destruction."

<h3>CHAPTER 7</h3>
<p>Somehow calming myself from that incident I returned back to Prakash-San. I was very scared that he would hate me now that I have shown such a bizarre behaviour. But Prakash-San was completely opposite, he said, "Are you all right, I didn't know you were this sensitive, I was just teasing you a bit." All the friends of Prakash-San were kind to me and apologised even though they did nothing wrong.
<br>
We had fun and talked about a lot of things. After that we parted for our homes. Prakash-san and I were going through the same route. I didn't know that Prakash-san and I lived near. I was just thrilled that I was spending some alone time with Prakash-san. We had almost no talk during the walk but somehow I felt like I have been talking to Prakash-san for hours. As we were halfway from our homes rain suddenly started to pour. Both of us ran towards the nearest bus stop to take shelter. Prakash-san said in an annoyed voice, "uhhh now how are we supposed to go home now?" 
<br>
Luckily I was carrying a umbrella that day just in case. There was a umbrella for me but not for Prakash-san. So, a thought came up in my mind that was to take revenge from Prakash-san for what he did to me earlier. I took out the umbrella I had from my bag and said," ummm.... Prakash-san I have an umbrella but only one so..... if u would like we can sh.... share..." ofcourse i said that as a joke and as I was about to laugh it out Prakash-san said," Thanks a lot, you are a literal lifesaver." I had thought that he would blush after hearing me say that but he didn't show a single bit of embarrassment on his face he took my umbrella from my hand and open it and asked me,"let's go, " my brain couldn't process what was happening. To add up to this Prakash-san grabbed my hand and pulled me towards him I was slammed to Prakash-san. I could feel the warmth from his body. I quickly backed away in an sense of disgrace that I came so close to him. On the other hand Prakash-san seemed like he had no problem with me being close. Despite the case I still stayed as far from Prakash-san as i could.
<br>
The sound of raindrops of falling on the umbrella was Lound and clear as we were walking silently. It was as we were a 14 Year couple on their first date who couldn't speak a single word. ( reference from my close friend Buddha).
<br>
Two young highschoolers walking together under the same umbrella, it would definitely create indecent thoughts in other people's mind. With this thinking I backed away even more to a point that my left shoulder started to get wet in the rain. Prakash-san immediately realised this and pulled me towards him with his left hand. With his left hand on my left shoulder he said in a blushing emotion," I wouldn't want you to be get cold because of me". I thought to myself,"how caring can he even be?" I replied saying,"Prakash-san don't you think we are too close [note : Prakash-san was kinda hugging our fmc]
<br>
 what will other people think? What if your g..gir..girlfriend or crush sees us like that?" Prakash-san said laughingly , "pfffft.... I don't have a girlfriend or a crush, also I don't care what other people think I just don't want you to catch a cold" 
<br>
These were the humbel words which made me fall in love with him even more. We went through the way like lovers although we're not. I wished that this walk would never end. But it's the rule of nature everything must come to an end. We reached Prakash-san's home. It was not very far from my home . I dropped off Prakash-san and he said," thank you so much, would you like to wait at my house for the rain to calm down. I can make us some tea." " me staying at my crushes home? " I thought to myself. The rain grew even more . It felt like destiny wanted us together. So I accepted his offer. 
There I was in my crushes home. I asked him where are yr parents and he replied " they are at work I am home alone currently "" whatttttt????????" I thought to myself.</p>

<h3> Chapter 8</h3>
<p>Prakash-san invited me to his house, I was in a sense of dilemma considering the fact whether it was a dream or reality. My crush, the person whom I admired for so long invited me to his own house. How could I miss this opportunity?  
<br>
I accepted Prakash-san's invitation. Prakash-san as gentleman opened the door for me and there I was alone in a house with my crush. I sat down on the entrance with nervousness and opened my shoe which was wet because of the rain. Both of us were partially wet because we only had 1 umbrella. The thought still made my heart beat like crazy.
<br>
<br>
When did it start?
<br>
<br>
A normal highschool girl in their Crush's home for the first time. What sight it was...
<br>
With a very calm and welcoming feeling, I was standing inside Prakash-san's home. Prakesh-san softly, with a gentle approach, told to sit in the living room. He left and scurried  towards the kitchen. Although he had a calm look in his face, I could tell he was a bit nervous.
<br>
Alter what felt like so long, Prakash-san came back with Warm tea in his hands. With a random smirk on his face, he gently placed down the tea on the table and sat right beside me. Ofcourse, I was startled with this. In one's crush's home, sitting right beside them who wouldn't be nervous?
<br>
There was this awkward silence between us. As I took a sip from the warm sweet tea Prakash-san gazed his sight over me.  I stared right back at him and there was this sudden but long eye contact between us. I was lost by those magnificent and ravishing eyes of Prakash-san. He gently rolled his eyes towards the tea,put it down at the table and stared right back at me again.
<br>
My heart was beating like crazy, my ears were red and...
Not only me even prakash-san was red as beetroot.
<br>
<br>
Love is a mad game, you never realize when you fall for it,
And when you when you do its too late.
Now you are how stuck in this gamble of acception or rejection.
Acception can be as sweet as honey,but rejection will be more painful then being burnt alive....
<br>
<br>
Prakash-san's face was so close to mine. I didn't even hesitate to move away. My mind was all blank, all I could think was of Prakash-San. The room was quite as an abandoned town. I could hear the rapid heartbeat of Prakash-San. It felt like our heart  beat simontaneuosly.
As of all the fuss in my mind, Prakash-San leaned towards me 
AND.....
<br>
<br>
I always wondered,"What does your first kiss taste like?"
For me the answer was,"SWEET"....
<br></p>

<h3>Chapter 9 END</h3>
<p>CONTEXT:ITS THE NEXT DAY AND THE STORY CONTINUES WITH OUR FMC's PRESPECTIVE.
<br>
<br>
I could still remember what happened last night. In the morning I murmured to myself saying, " It must all be a dream, how could I and Prakash-san ever do things like that?"
But it surely wasn't a dream because I couldn't sleep the whole night. It was 6 am in the morning and I was wide awake.
My school started at 9 am, so I got out of made and stared at the dark wall of my room for 20 minutes, my mind was filled with the faint memories of what happened yesterday. I eventually got ready for school, I was immaculately timorous about meeting Prakash-san. I was distressed about what Prakash-san would say to me.
<br>
<br>
Finally I departed from my house, I was so frightened, I was willing to skip school and go live in a dark woods for eternity. But I didn't.  
<br>
<br>
I took small steps towards my school. As I arrived near the crossing, i noticed Prakash-san at the other side of the road.
I tried to scurry away, but Prakash-San noticed me. I was shook by his serious sight. I waved at him, with my hands shaking, and he waved at me back. He came towards me looking me dead at my eyes. After reaching close to me, he muttered at me,"About what happened yesterday..... sorry I couldn't hold back, I apologise if u hated that. "
<br>
<br>
"No, I didn't.......especially hate it,I kinda liked it" I replied with a soft voice. Prakash-san rolled his eyes with some sense of relief and smirked towards me. 
He hollered,"meet me at the park near your house at 6 pm in the evening . LETS CONTINUE THERE....."
After saying these lines Prakash-san rushed towards school out of my sight. It was as he teleported away. I thought, what are we gonna continue there? 
THEN IT SUDDENLY STRUCK ME....
<br>
<br>
I couldn't think straight for the whole day. I couldn't concentrate on any of my classes. My heart was in a constant fear of what was going to happen? 
<br>
<br>
What will Prakash-san do?
<br>
What does he mean by "lets continue"?
<br>
It felt like time didn't work, time passed so slowly for me, every five minute I would look at my watch, waiting for the current period to end. A single line that Prakash-san said left in a sense of anxiety. When it was lunch break, I couldn't take it anymore. I went straight to Prakash-san and asked him what he wanted to tell. But he said "Sorry, I cannot tell you here" and left. It felt like he was avoiding me. Slowly but surely school ended and I rushed home. It was 4 30 pm when I reached home. 1 and half hours remain I said and started to get ready, I took a bath, did my makeup and wore a cute dress. If you can't tell till now I was expecting a confession...
<br>
<br>
At 5 :30 I left my home and scurried towards the park. It was just 5 minutes away from my home. My heart was throbbing so fast. I was breathing heavily. I couldn't think straight...
<br>
<br>
People say life is an adventure, you never know what's coming in life next,  Jeewan ma kahile ukali aaucha bhane kahile orali auuchan. ( I couldn't properly translate it in English). My life took a devastating turn that evening.
<br>
<br>
It was a dark evening. The lights in the street were shining, the full moon had come out. I finally reached the destination I had been waiting for the whole day. I was across the park and I could see prakash-san across the road in the park with a bouquet in his hand. My guess was correct. Prakash-san signaled me to stay there. He also seemed nervous, I could tell by looking at his face.
<br>
<br>
I can still remember that night, which stole the burning flame from my heart. The dark blanket that night layed over my heart was never taken off. 
<br>
<br>
Prakash-san rushed towards he, with the bouquet in his hand, I was crying with happiness. Tears were dropping from my eyes. Soon those tears of happiness turned into tears of sadness. As prakash-san was crossing the road to reach me, a bright light came and hit prakash-san. All I remember was the devastating scene of blood spreading over the road. My mind went blank, I lost it all. I saw prakash-san lying in the middle of the road, the bouquet all crushed up still in his hand, blood everywhere. I ran over towards Prakash-san holding him in my lap. I was crying uncontrollably, tears were dropping from my eyes. I could see blood everywhere, I could see Prakash-san heavily injured. 
<br>
<br>
I cried to prakash-san," Why did this happen?  why? Why! Prakash-san.... I...I....love you, I don't want to see you like this, I wanted to be together with you, dont leave me. "
<br>
<br>
Even though he was in intense pain he slowly muttered, " Life is unfair....fufufu.... when I finally gathered the courage to tell you about my feelings..... I guess God didn't want us together.
I am sorry I couldn't be with you in my current life.... but I wish we could be together in our next life. 
<br>
<br>
I am sorry I couldn't notice your feelings early,
<br>
I am sorry I couldn't take you on any dates,
<br>
I am sorry I was a bother to you,
<br>
I am sorry u had to waste your feelings on someone like me,
<br>
I am sorry for all the trouble I gave you,
<br>
<br>
I am sorry for everything. I think this is it for me, tell my family I love them and thanks for all they have done for me. Life was short but sweet for me. I am happy I get to rest at the lap of the person I love. If I get another life I will be sure to be Prakash-san again so that I can meet you. Ahhhh.... what do I left to say.... ahhh yes,
<b>The moon is looking beautiful today isn't it?....</b>*hahaha he laughed softly*, I will be waiting for you in the other side."
<br>
<br>
I could feel the warmth from Prakash-sans body but soon this warmth dissappeared. With the faithful and pleasant words, Prakash-san gently closed his eyes and never opened them again...
<br>
<br>
That was the day when life turned upside down for me, I blamed myself for his demise. The burning flame in my heart was blown off and I was left in the dark abysses alone.....
<br>
<br>
I wonder what would have happened, if only I had put out my feelings for him early?
<br>
