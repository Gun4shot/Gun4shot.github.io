<u>Chapter-1 -On the cold winter evening</u> 
<br> 
<br>
The word "FATE" many people believe it whereas many take it as a matter of joke or as a superstition. Whether you believe it or not but for our main characters, it totally looks like the work of fate. The work of God who wanted them together.

<u>2078 , falgun</u> <br>
<br>
On a cold winter evening, school period running, students not paying their attention, kids shouting from their classes, toppers and nerds casually paying attention. There he was Prabesh, an average student who was quite average in academics but was somewhat better in athletics. He had gotten into working out which got him in quite a good shape. From a young age, he was quite fascinated about romance and its dimensions, he was quite interested in the topic love. He watched a lot of movies, animes, tv shows and knew all kind of things about the topic, but he was yet to experience what love feels like. As to talk about his personality he was a cheerful young boy aged 14, a healthy teenager who was kind,helpful but a little arrogant. His bad traits were hidden by his good ones. He always payed attention in class even if he understood nothing of it. He was a good boy but lately he couldn't focus in his classes. There was always this specific someone who used to drive his attention. Ofcourse it was Prashamsha.
<br>
<br>
Prashamsha was also an average student who was average in her academics but hated maths. She was also 14 but a few months older then Prabesh. She was a bit short but good looking and always had this attractive light towards her, her inner light which was not seen by others but was seen quite well by Prabesh. She was neat,disciplined,well-mannered and cheerful, she always spoke politely with others and was innocent as a flower. She was also kind and helpful like Prabesh. Maybe this was what attracted them together, Who knows?
<br>
<br>
Prabesh and Prashamsha lived in the same neighbourhood, their houses next to each other and their parents very good friends, we can almost say that they were childhood friends. They played together when they were young, had a lot of fun and enjoyed a healthy childhood. In Class UKG, Prashamsha out of her little heart, she dared to propose to him. (Prabesh)
This was just like a play,like an act, so Ofcourse Prabesh turned it down. During that time Prabesh was quite innocent and didn't have that so much interest in such things. Prabesh couldn't comprehend this and was dense about it but it definitely seemed like a game played between two small kids. Relations and proposals done at a young age are never taken seriously not by an adult nor by a child. But who knew that this was just a teaser about what was about to happen next. It almost seemed like FATE tried to pull them together. God sitting in his almighty throne playing this game of life and pulling two souls together to be one. Who knows?
<br>
<br>
Returning back to present time, Prabesh was sitting in the 4th row and Prashamsha on the other side of the class at 4th row aswell. Both of them were side by side to each other. Prabesh and Prashamsha were quite good friends from the start to begin with, they talked a lot and somewhere in those talking both of them developed feelings for each other. Prabesh would be often lost in her eyes while talking with her. They would sometimes even stare at each other like they were having a conversation just with there eyes. Prashamsha was dissolved in the kind and cheerful personality of him. It was now a matter of time until both of them realized that their love was mutual. This is where a magar boy udaya comes to save them. It was like he was a messanger sent by the gods. Udaya was quite good friend of Prabesh as well as of Prashamsha. Uday, in his teenage, was exicted about crushes. He was interested in knowing who was the one who Prabesh liked. So, one day he decided to ask about it, he went to Prabesh and asked with a grin on his face,"Hey, Prabesh let me ask you a question, would you mind?"
<br>
<br>
Prabesh replied with hesitation, "No, I won't go ahead"
Uday takes a deep breath and asks it,"Who is your crush? Tell me I know you have one?"
<br>
<br>
Prabesh was definitely not going to reveal this but that day, his inner heart felt a weird sensation, his heart was screaming the name Prashamsha. He couldn't hold it in, it was too much for him so in excitement he replied,"Ahh...well don't tell anyone but it's Pra....Prashamsha"
Hearing this Uday cheered, Prabesh's face was red just from taking the name of his loved one. 
<br>
<br>
Watching Prabesh and Prashamsha together, anyone could tell they were in love with each other. And ofcourse Even Uday was aware if this, so he asked Prashamsha the same question and her reply was,"Don't tell anyone but it's Pr..Prabesh "Hearing this Udays suspicion turned into a fact. He was sure that their love was mutual. Now it was just a matter of spreading this news. He at first told Prashamsha that Prabesh had feelings for her and told the same thing to Prabesh later. Now both of them knew that their love was mutual, it was just a matter of who proposed first. Knowing that their love was mutual how could they not be happy. 
<br>
<br>
At this point both of their lives changed dramatically, Prabesh upon seeing Prashamsha would now avoid her,as he had no idea what to do next. The same happened for Prashamsha as well. Both of them avoided each other. But this didn't last long. Udaya convinced Prabesh to let out his feelings to her, to propose to her. After a lot of convincing, Prabesh finally got the push he needed, he finally decided he will do it, he will let his feelings out which were building inside of him. 
<br> 
<br>
<u>On the 6th period, OBTE </u>
<br>
<br>
Prabesh was glancing over at Prashamsha from the side as he was lucky enough that he was sitting right next to Prashamsha. Cherry on top, Udaya was sitting right next to Prabesh for his support. Prabesh was red as beetroot, he was paying no attention towards the class, his attention was driven all towards Prashamsha. Prabesh had an intention of proposing to Prashamsha but didn't know the exact time to do it. Sometimes in life we don't know the proper timing of things. Ofcourse there is an appropriate time for everything and for Prabesh that was the exact right time. With a lot of motivation from Uday, it happend.....
<br>
<br>
"I....love you"
<br>
<br>
These are the exact words that set lit to this story. As these 3 magical words entered the ears of Prashamsha, she was filled with delight, out of nowhere she had a proposal in the middle of the class, it happened all of a sudden. Prashamsha was nervous hearing these words. She was stood shocked for a minute, her mind went blank, she could only think of one thing and that was Prabesh, her mind was not working for a moment there. Prabesh sat quietly there for a minute. In the noise of the entire class, there sat two love birds completely silent as they were speaking through their hearts. 
<br>
<br>
Finally Prashamsha answered with,"I love you too". <br>
Hearing this Prabesh almost fainted. This embarked their relationship. This was the wind that sailed away the boat. This was the journey of their love decided by faith. Although they passed the first test of their love, there stood a hundred more tests for them to clear.....
