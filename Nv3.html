   <p>Once upon a time, there was a young man named Bura who lived in a small town. He was an a vid gamer, spending most of his time playing his favorite online Vr game, NORD. He wasn't that much of a good player but he used to play a lot of his time just grinding the game and watching anime. He hadn't gone out in years. It was that worse that he hadnt touched grass in a very long time. BTW when is the last time u touched grass?. Days passes by, yet he still is just playing game to complete a single quest.

     <h3>CHAPTER 2 --The plot--</h3>
     <p>When he opened his eyes he found the place somewhat familiar.Before he died he was completing a quest.
"Oh yes, I was being attacked by the enemy troops and I also died in it. And now I am here again in the quest. Is it a glitch?" he wondered. He tried moving his hands, it worked! He tried experimenting a bit. After a while he confirmed that he was indeed dead in real life but also died in the game at the same time . Something must have happened so that he actually respawn in the game in his real self" he thought to himself. Since he is in a quest he has to complete it to get the outside bigger world of Nord. Many people would be frightened in such unreal situation but for bura, he couldn't hold back his excitement and started to prepare for the quest.</p>
