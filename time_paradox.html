  <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
  <div class="time">
I am seldon, a normal person who is not normal. I work at a private company. Everyone else thinks that but I am an undercover detective for my country. The military may save the country on the ground but underground and behind the scenes we do all the work.
   <br>
   <br>
It was a normal day in my life but it all changed in a few hours. At 3 pm, I went to my son's school to pick him up but to my surprise there was a time capsule event going on. *[ Time capsule is a thing done in foreign schools where kids keep some of their stuffs in a capsule and burry it somewhere and they are undug after few years by the next generation of students]* I thought it was an interesting event so I sat down and watched it. I was eager to see what kind of things will enroll from the time capsule. This small event which I thought was fun changed my entire life.
<br>
<br>
The time capsule was opened and many interesting things came out, the kids were allowed to take 1 item with them as memories. From among the items one item caught my eye. It was a large sized paper with just numbers written over it. Both sides of the paper were covered with numbers like there was a secret number language and a long story was written in it. As a curious detective I am I told my son to bring me that paper. What others would have thought was a complete garbage to me it seemed a great mystery to solve. I brought the paper to my home and studied about it. At the seventh line of the paper there was a number more over a coordinate written over it. It went like "88.87767638  27.876252627 " it seemed like a random decimal but what made me sure it was a coordinate is that it was very close to my houses coordinate and it was written in bold letters. I immediately called my son at my office. I rarely let my son into my office as there are many secret documents in there. So, my son "sandy" was quite profound and confused to step foot inside my office. I pulled sandy towards the big sized paper. Pointing towards the paper full of numbers I asked sandy,"Son, do you have any idea what this paper is? Or why this paper exists? " sandy replied with a confusing look,"I have no idea about it." I told my son,"This is an interesting piece of paper. *pointing towards the bolded numbers" See this, they seem like  coordinates to me and they are really close by. Wanna go and check it out?" My son was shocked by my bizarre behaviour, he must have thought that I went crazy. Despite all those, he reluctantly agreed going with me. 
<br>
<br>
As a curious person I was, I got in my car with my son and zoomed out towards the coordinate. I put the coordinates on Google maps and it guided me to the place. It was about a 34 minute drive from my house. When we got out of the house, we immediately faced a traffic jam. It wasted 32 minutes of out time. Both of us sighed with frustration. Putting this out of my mind I scurried towards the place. I was definitely overspeeding but I didn't care a bit. The excitement and curiosity of mine just couldn't wait. But soon I realised that I had made a big mistake by acting in a rush which still haunts me to this day. While we were 0.77 km away from the place, a 4 way junction appeared. I was overspeeding and ignored the red signal. As I sped pass the signal a giant truck came from my right. At that moment I realised what great mistake I made. I had my son with me and I was there in a fight or flight situation with milliseconds to react....The next decision I take was the decision of death of life... 
<br>
<br>
"Was it destiny that didn't want me to reach the place or was it someone or something else?..."
